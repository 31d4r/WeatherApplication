# WeatherApplication

Since I stareted developing an apps for iOS devices I always was thinking what to make, what to learn new and today I decided to mak a small, simply app for iOS. This is also presentation of my skills using web requests and parsing JSON into array.

Frameworks I used for this :: Cocoa Pods
Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, NVActivityIndicatorView
