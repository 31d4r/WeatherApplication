# WeatherApplication

Since I stareted developing an apps for iOS devices I always was thinking what to make, what to learn new and today I decided to make a simply app for iOS. This is also presentation of my skills using web requests and parsing JSON into array.

This app uses famous framework and also has an auto-layout so it means it fits for all iPhone devices without any problem.

Frameworks I used for this :: Cocoa Pods
Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, NVActivityIndicatorView

ALAMOFIRE: https://cocoapods.org/pods/Alamofire <br/>
SWIFTYJSON: https://cocoapods.org/pods/SwiftyJSON <br/>
NVActivityIndicatorView: https://cocoapods.org/pods/NVActivityIndicatorView

For "catching" weather I used "OpenWeatherMap" api for daily/current weather data:
URL: https://openweathermap.org/current

Applicaion is also using current user geolocation, so it means after you open an app you need to give a permission to app to return you current weather data for your city.
